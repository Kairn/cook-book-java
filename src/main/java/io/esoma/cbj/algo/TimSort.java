/**
 * Class for implementing the Timsort algorithm. Timsort is a hybrid stable
 * sorting algorithm, derived from merge sort and insertion sort, designed to
 * perform well on many kinds of real-world data. It was implemented by Tim
 * Peters in 2002 for use in the Python programming language. It is also used to
 * sort arrays of non-primitive type in Java SE 7, on the Android platform, in
 * GNU Octave, on V8, and Swift. Timsort was designed to take advantage of runs
 * of consecutive ordered elements that already exist in most real-world data,
 * natural runs. In a nutshell, the main routine marches over the array once,
 * left to right, alternately identifying the next run, then merging it into the
 * previous runs "intelligently".
