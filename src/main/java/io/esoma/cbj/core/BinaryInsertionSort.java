/**
 * Class for implementing the binary insertion sort algorithm. Insertion sort is
 * a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a
 * time. It iterates, consuming one input element each repetition, and growing a
 * sorted output list. At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element
 * from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list,
 * and inserts it there. It repeats until no input elements remain. Binary
 * insertion sort employs a binary search to determine the correct location to
 * insert new elements. It is efficient for small data sets and thus typically
 * leveraged in more complex or hybrid sorting algorithms.
